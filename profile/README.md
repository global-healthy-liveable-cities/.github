# Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators Collaboration

In 2018, at the 7th International Society for Physical Activity and Health held in London, the World Health Organization launched its global physical activity strategy for â€˜More Active People for a Healthier Worldâ€™ and the multidisciplinary Global Healthy and Sustainable City-Indicators Collaboration was established.  At meetings of the International Physical Environment Network (IPEN) and the Council of the Environment and Physical Activity (ISPAH CEPA), we recruited collaborators in 25 cities in 19 countries and six continents to participate in the first part of this study, with results published in 2022.  With expertise in public health, urban and transport planning, urban design, architecture, computer and geospatial science, behavioural science, statistics, epidemiology, complex systems science, and public policy the aim of the Global Healthy and Sustainable City-Indicators Collaboration was to identify and measure health-related policy and spatial indicators in cities worldwide

The Global Healthy and Sustainable City Collaboration involves over 80 collaborators from 25 cities in 19 countries.  To oversee the study, an international 13-member study Executive was established, and has met monthly since 2018.
